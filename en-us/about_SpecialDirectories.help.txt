    Special Directories

SHORT DESCRIPTION

    Special Directories  are a  way to  quickly navigate  to important
    parts of the namespace.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    Special Directories are a set of directories, each  of which has a
    function that will navigate you to the appropriate directory using
    the push-location  cmdlet. For example,  the function "home" might
    navigate to "c:\users\bdewey."

USING SPECIAL DIRECTORIES

    The   Get-SpecialDirectories  cmdlet  will  return   the  list  of
    currently active special directories. For example:

        C:\users\bdewey\Powershell> Get-SpecialDirectories

        Name                           Value
        ----                           -----
        tools                          E:\tools
        temp                           C:\Users\bdewey\AppData\Local\Temp
        wn                             e:\tools\OneNoteWebAsService
        home                           c:\users\bdewey

    The Name property is  the name of  the function that will navigate
    you to the directory; the Value property is the directory that you
    will navigate to.

    New-SpecialDirectory  will   create   a new   special   directory.
    Remove-SpecialDirectory   will    remove  a    special  directory.
    Update-SpecialDirectories will ensure  that  all of the  functions
    that map to special directories are defined.
